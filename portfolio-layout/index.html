                    <p>I have designed performances for many films and TV shows, where I have trained the actors for their characters, many of whom have been awarded for their performances. These performance design sessions are attended by many professional
                        actors with vast experience and most of them being already trained from many reputed acting schools from India and abroad.</p>
                    <p>Every actor needs characterisation training which is a common practice in Hollywood, that's why they are able to create unique and innovative characters; like a cricketer needs a coach to create and polish his performance in the match,
                        in the same manner an actor needs a coach to create great character and achieve an applaudable performance in a project. I have successfully designed many such performances and industry is realising its necessity.</p>

                <h2>What is Performance design</h2>
                <p>Its a very specialised job. Performance design is a process of creating a character out of plain words.</p>
                <p>As we know that in films and tv serials, if the characters are unique and innovative, they immediately connect with the audience and create history. A story revolves around characters, characters are not just written words, its a living
                    being and if we fail to translate the written character into that living being, our efforts go wasted. Decoding authors vision is our main motive. We design subconscious of a character, their drive, their history, their inspiration,
                    aspirations, motivations. </p>
                <p>We work on 3 basic following levels - For TV & films.</p>
